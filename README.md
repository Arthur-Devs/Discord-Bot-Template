# Bot Discord Template 

This is a template for a Discord bot. It is written in TypeScript and uses the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org) library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v12 or higher)

### Setup environment variables

You will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project. This file will contain your bot's token and other environment variables. The `.env` file is ignored by git, so you will not accidentally commit it.

You can copy the contents of `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.

## Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Use `npm ci` to install dependencies
3. Use `npm run dev` to start the bot in development mode

## Deployment

1. Use `npm run build` to build the bot
2. In the `build` directory, use `npm ci --production` to install dependencies
3. Launch the bot with `npm start`
